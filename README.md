This is an iOS framework, which incorporates multiple security controls into one framework. It was written for a Master's thesis about iOS application security as a proof-of-concept project. 

### List of implemented security controls ###

* Debugger controls
* Jailbreak controls
* Integrity controls, including application encryption presence check (64 and 32 bit)
* NSUserDefaults and File (writeToFile:, initWithContentsOfFile: methods) encryption
* NSValueTransformer subclass to support Core Data attributes encryption
* Protection against unintended data leakage through text fields and iOS screenshots
* SSL pinning and SSL certificate validation
* Protection against insecure data logging
* WebView and URL scheme whitelisting

### Framework architecture ###

The framework relies on Objective-C runtime to automatically inject validation logic. However, the framework does not change any system APIs behaviour, but only intercepts methodsâ€™ invocations, performs needed operations and proceeds with original implementation. **Each and every time the original method implementation will be called to ensure that nothing will break in the application!**

The general architecture is depicted on this diagram:
